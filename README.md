# Spring Studies
Studies in Spring Framework.

This repo is based on the Udemy class [Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru).
The referenced repos are [Spring Framework Guru Pet Clinic](https://github.com/springframeworkguru/sfg-pet-clinic)  and [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic).

I have changed the app to use Java 1.8, SCSS, Bootstrap 4+, FontAwesome and Thymeleaf 3.  In doing so, I have removed the default Thymeleaf 2, wro4j and Less to CSS compilation.
Also, did some updated layout and styling in the owners view.
